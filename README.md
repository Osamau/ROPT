The `quantmod` program, the 'GA' package, and the genetic algorithm will all be utilized to obtain the historical prices for 10 assets. The `PerformanceAnalytics` would be used to compute financial parameters such as betas, Treynor ratio and Sharpe ratio. The "maxdrawdown" function, which is part of the `tvseries` package, is used to compute the maximum drawdown, which represents the worst investment loss for an asset investment made using a buy-and-hold strategy.
